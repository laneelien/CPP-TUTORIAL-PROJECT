# CPP-TUTORIAL-PROJECT
Intro project to clone, modify, test, branch, push, run code using github

For this Project these are your instructions:

1) Use git Bash to Clone the Repo on your computer
2) Run the main.cpp code and test the code operation
3) Modify the code to:
     * Save the sentence that the user enters about them selves and output the number of words and the average word length (Use Generative Ai to get initial code that you will debug to get it functioning well)
     * Create a function to perform the operation to determin if the entered number is prime. Your function should return true if prime and false if not prime. This message should also be output to the console using COUT
5) Capture a screenshot of your code results and save it as testresults.png project folder
6) Update the input.txt file with your responses that I will use for testing
7) Save your files
8) Use git bash to do the following
     * Create a branch that you will upload your code as (/yourLastName-CPP-Tutorial) (Use ChatGPT to find out how)
     * Add all the modified Files to your branch (git add .)
     * Create a commit to your branch with a commit message describing your changes to the program (git commit -m "put your commit msg here")
     * Push your code to git (git push origin (your branch name)
9) Go to the repo on Github --> Actions and Run the code you uploaded in your branch
